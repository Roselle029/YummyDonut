            <p>"Yummy Donuts. A complete paradigm shift when you think about donuts. You can enjoy without feeling so much guilty about the sweetness. It is just so flavorfully sweet and yet light to eat. A really pleasant surprise. It is hard to say which is my favorite since each donut flavor that I taste becomes a favorite. Check it out and experience it yourself."</p>

            <p>"Best tasting doughnut I had. Texture is soft, creamy and not too sweet, you can definitely taste the berries. Canâ€™t wait to try all the flavors! I love Berry Glazed."</p>

            <p>" Recently they launched a new doughnut variety, Maple Bacon. It combines tasty flavors of bacon and maple. As soon as I got my hands on a box, I immediately finished one. I liked that it had a balance of savory and sweetness in one bite. Its salty ingredients tamed the usual sweetness from Yummy doughnuts. Expect sweet, super soft dough and a bit of crunch from the bacon bits.  "</p>
